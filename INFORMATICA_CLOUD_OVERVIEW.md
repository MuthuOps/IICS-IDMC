Introduction to IICS
What is IICS?
- IICS stands for Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services. It is a next-generation iPaaS solution that 
can be used to exchange data between applications or business partners. You can use IICS to 
integrate, synchronize, and relate data, applications, and processes residing on-premise or in your

connection with the Informatica Cloud Services, which includes the IICS repository, that 
stores various information about the task as above image shows.

IICS Repository
• When you create, schedule, and run tasks, its information is written to the IICS repository.
• The repository stores metadata for each source and target object. This includes field names,
data type, precision, and other information about the source and the target object.
